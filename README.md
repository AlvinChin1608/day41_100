# day41_100
I am currently engaged in a 100-day Python Bootcamp, which I am documenting and sharing my progress on GitHub. The boot camp is designed to progressively intensify, allowing me to deepen my understanding and proficiency in Python programming.

Additionally, I have chosen to include the beginner, intermediate and advanced in my documentation to provide a valuable reference for my future growth and development.

# HTML Tags: <header>, <br>, <hr>, and <p>
In my journey of learning HTML, I've explored several essential tags that help structure and format web content. Here are some of the key tags I've learned:

## <header>
The __<header>__ tag is used to define the header section of a document or a section. It usually contains introductory content or navigational links.
```python
<header>
  <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
  <nav>
    <a href="#home">Home</a>
    <a href="#about">About</a>
    <a href="#contact">Contact</a>
  </nav>
</header>
```

## <br>
The __<br>__ tag is used to insert a line break within text content. It is an empty tag, meaning it does not have a closing tag.

## <hr>
The __<hr>__ tag represents a thematic break in the content and is typically displayed as a horizontal line. It is used to separate content into distinct sections.
